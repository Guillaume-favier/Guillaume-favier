## Languages :

 - bash

## Goals :
 - Learn new languages 
 - Understand network

## Other things :
 - I'm french
 - I've done a lot of front end in past but now I don't like it anymore


## My favorite projects :
 - [mp2iciv.fr](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/mp2iciv.fr), what ends up being my biggest project from now, it's a website to organize all of our class timetable homework and the leaders of each test.
 - [ti83python-menulib](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/ti83python-menulib), it's a framework for python on the calculator ti83+ python edition, because code on this thing is a pain, so I made a framework to simplify things
 - [wordSearchFinder](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/wordSearchFinder) it's a nodejs project to find word in a wordSearch grid. I've made it because I suck at solving those
