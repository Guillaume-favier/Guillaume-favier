## Goals :

## Other things :
 - I'm french
 - I've done a lot of front end in past but now I don't like it anymore


## My favorite projects :
 - [mp2iciv.fr](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/EDTServ), what edned up being my biggest project, it's a website to organize all of our class timetable, homework, and a very modular work and ability to export to a lot of format.
 - [ti83python-menulib](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/ti83python-menulib), it's a framework for python on the calculator ti83+ python edition, because code on this thing is a pain, so I made a framework to simplify things
 - [wordSearchFinder](https://github.com/Guillaume-favier/wordSearchFinder) it's a nodejs project to find word in a wordSearch grid. I've made it because I suck at solving those
